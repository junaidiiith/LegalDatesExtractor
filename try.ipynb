       "'Toronto is the most populous city in Canada and the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario. With a population of 2,794,356 in 2021, it is the fourth-most populous city in North America. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,765,188 people (as of 2021) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area proper had a 2021 population of 6,712,341. As of 2024, the CMA had an estimated population of 7,106,379. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, sports, and culture and is one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.\\nIndigenous peoples have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area, located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest, for more than 10,000 years. After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown, the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada. During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops. York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto. It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation. The city proper has since expanded past its original limits through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 (243.3 sq mi).\\nThe diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. About half of its residents were born outside of Canada and over 200 ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants. While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city. The mayor of Toronto is elected by direct popular vote to serve as the chief executive of the city. The Toronto City Council is a unicameral legislative body, comprising 25 councillors since the 2018 municipal election, representing geographical wards throughout the city.\\nToronto is a prominent centre for music, theatre, motion picture production, and television production, and is home to the headquarters of Canada\\'s major national broadcast networks and media outlets. Its varied cultural institutions, which include numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 43 million tourists each year. Toronto is known for its many skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the CN Tower, the tallest freestanding structure on land outside of Asia.\\nThe city is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange, the headquarters of Canada\\'s five largest banks, and the headquarters of many large Canadian and multinational corporations. Its economy is highly diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, aerospace, environmental innovation, food services, and tourism. Toronto is the third-largest tech hub in North America after Silicon Valley and New York City, and the fastest-growing hub.\\n\\n\\n== Toponymy ==\\n\\nThe word Toronto has been recorded with various spellings in French and English, including Tarento, Tarontha, Taronto, Toranto, Torento, Toronto, and Toronton. The most frequent early spelling, Taronto, referred to \\'The Narrows\\', a channel of water through which Lake Simcoe discharges into Lake Couchiching where the Huron had planted tree saplings to corral fish. This narrows was called tkaronto by the Mohawk, meaning \\'where there are trees standing in the water\\', and was recorded as early as 1615 by Samuel de Champlain. The word Toronto, meaning \\'plenty\\', also appears in a 1632 French lexicon of the Huron language, which is also an Iroquoian language. It also appears on French maps referring to various locations, including Georgian Bay, Lake Simcoe, and several rivers. A portage route from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron running through this point, known as the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, led to widespread use of the name.\\nThe pronunciation of the city is broadly   tə-RONT-oh, which locals pronounce [təˈɹɒnoʊ] or [ˈtɹɒnoʊ], leaving the second \\'t\\' silent.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early history ===\\n\\nThe site of Toronto lay at the entrance to one of the oldest routes to the northwest, a route known and used by the Huron, Iroquois, and Ojibwe. Archaeological sites show evidence of human occupation dating back thousands of years. The site was of strategic importance from the beginning of Ontario\\'s recorded history.\\nIn the 1660s, the Iroquois established two villages within what is today Toronto, Ganatsekwyagon (Bead Hill) on the banks of the Rouge River and Teiaiagon on the banks of the Humber River. By 1701, the Mississaugas had displaced the Iroquois, who abandoned the Toronto area at the end of the Beaver Wars, with most returning to their homeland in present-day New York state.\\nFrench traders founded Fort Rouillé in 1750 (the current Exhibition grounds were later developed there), but abandoned it in 1759 during the Seven Years\\' War. The British defeated the French and their indigenous allies in the war, and the area became part of the British colony of Quebec in 1763.\\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, an influx of British settlers arrived there as United Empire Loyalists fled for the British-controlled lands north of Lake Ontario. The Crown granted them land to compensate for their losses in the Thirteen Colonies. The new province of Upper Canada was being created and needed a capital. In 1787, the British Lord Dorchester arranged for the Toronto Purchase with the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, thereby securing more than a quarter of a million acres (1000 km2) of land in the Toronto area. Dorchester intended the location to be named Toronto. The first 25 years after the Toronto purchase were quiet, although \"there were occasional independent fur traders\" present in the area, with the usual complaints of debauchery and drunkenness.\\nIn 1793, Governor John Graves Simcoe established the town of York on the Toronto Purchase lands, naming it after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Simcoe decided to move the Upper Canada capital from Newark (Niagara-on-the-Lake) to York, believing the new site would be less vulnerable to attack by the United States. The York garrison was built at the entrance of the town\\'s natural harbour, sheltered by a long sand-bar peninsula. The town\\'s settlement formed at the harbour\\'s eastern end behind the peninsula, near the present-day intersection of Parliament Street and Front Street (in the \"Old Town\" area).\\n\\n\\n=== 19th century ===\\n\\nIn 1813, as part of the War of 1812, the Battle of York ended in the town\\'s capture and plunder by United States forces. John Strachan negotiated the town\\'s surrender. American soldiers destroyed much of the garrison and set fire to the parliament buildings during their five-day occupation. Because of the sacking of York, British troops retaliated later in the war with the burning of Washington, D.C.\\nYork was incorporated as the City of Toronto on March 6, 1834, adopting the Indigenous name. Reformist politician William Lyon Mackenzie became the first mayor of Toronto. Mackenzie would later lead the unsuccessful Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837 against the British colonial government.\\nToronto\\'s population of 9,000 included some African-American slaves, some of whom had been brought by the Loyalists, and Black Loyalists, whom the Crown had freed (most of the latter were resettled in Nova Scotia). By 1834, refugee slaves from America\\'s South were also immigrating to Toronto to gain freedom. Slavery was banned outright in Upper Canada (and throughout the British Empire) in 1834. Torontonians integrated people of colour into their society. In the 1840s, an eating house at Frederick and King Streets, a place of mercantile prosperity in the early city, was operated by a black man named Bloxom.\\n\\nAs a major destination for immigrants to Canada, the city grew rapidly through the remainder of the 19th century. The first significant wave of immigrants were Irish, fleeing the Great Irish Famine; most of them were Catholic. By 1851, the Irish-born population had become the largest single ethnic group in the city. The Scottish and English population welcomed smaller numbers of Protestant Irish immigrants, some from what is now Northern Ireland, which gave the Orange Order significant and long-lasting influence over Toronto society. Almost every mayor of Toronto was a member of the Orange Order between 1850 and 1950, and the city was sometimes referred to as the \"Belfast of Canada\" because of Orange influence in municipal politics and administration.\\nFor brief periods, Toronto was twice the capital of the united Province of Canada: first from 1849 to 1851, following unrest in Montreal, and later from 1855 to 1859. After this date, Quebec was designated as the capital until 1865 (two years before Canadian Confederation). Since then, the capital of Canada has remained Ottawa, Ontario.\\n\\nToronto became the capital of the province of Ontario after its official creation in 1867. The seat of government of the Ontario briefly returned to the same building that hosted the Third Parliament Building of Upper Canada, before moving to the Ontario Legislative Building at Queen\\'s Park in 1893. Because of its provincial capital status, the city was also the location of Government House, the residence of the viceregal representative of the Crown in right of Ontario.\\nLong before the Royal Military College of Canada was established in 1876, supporters of the concept proposed military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a three-month-long military course at the School of Military Instruction in Toronto. Established by Militia General Order in 1864, the school enabled officers of militia or candidates for commission or promotion in the Militia to learn military duties, drill and discipline, to command a company at Battalion Drill, to drill a company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a company, and the duties of a company\\'s officer. The school was retained at Confederation, in 1867. In 1868, Schools of cavalry and artillery instruction were formed in Toronto.\\n\\nIn the 19th century, the city built an extensive sewage system to improve sanitation, and streets were illuminated with gas lighting as a regular service. Long-distance railway lines were constructed, including a route completed in 1854 linking Toronto with the Upper Great Lakes. The Grand Trunk Railway and the Northern Railway of Canada joined in the building of the first Union Station in downtown. The advent of the railway dramatically increased the numbers of immigrants arriving, commerce and industry, as had the Lake Ontario steamers and schooners entering port before. These enabled Toronto to become a major gateway linking the world to the interior of the North American continent. Expanding port and rail facilities brought in northern timber for export and imported Pennsylvania coal. Industry dominated the waterfront for the next 100 years.\\nDuring the late 19th century, Toronto became the largest alcohol distillation (in particular, spirits) centre in North America. By the 1860s, the Gooderham and Worts Distillery operations became the world\\'s largest whisky factory. A preserved section of this once dominant local industry remains in the Distillery District. The harbour allowed access to grain and sugar imports used in processing.\\n\\nHorse-drawn streetcars gave way to electric streetcars in 1891 when the city granted the operation of the transit franchise to the Toronto Railway Company. The public transit system passed into public ownership in 1921 as the Toronto Transportation Commission, later renamed the Toronto Transit Commission. The system now has the third-highest ridership of any city public transportation system in North America.\\n\\n\\n=== 20th century ===\\n\\nThe Great Toronto Fire of 1904 destroyed a large section of downtown Toronto. The fire destroyed more than 100 buildings. The fire claimed one victim, John Croft, who was an explosive expert clearing the ruins from the fire. It caused CA$10,387,000 in damage (roughly CA$277,600,000 in 2020 terms).\\nThe city received new European immigrant groups from the late 19th century into the early 20th century, particularly Germans, French, Italians, and Jews. They were soon followed by Russians, Poles, and other Eastern European nations, in addition to the Chinese entering from the West. Like the Irish before them, many of these migrants lived in overcrowded shanty-type slums, such as \"the Ward\", which was centred on Bay Street, now the heart of the country\\'s Financial District.\\nAs new migrants began to prosper, they moved to better housing in other areas, in what is now understood to be succession waves of settlement. Despite its fast-paced growth, by the 1920s, Toronto\\'s population and economic importance in Canada remained second to the much longer established Montreal, Quebec. However, by 1934, the Toronto Stock Exchange had become the largest in the country.\\n\\nIn 1954, the City of Toronto and 12 surrounding municipalities were federated into a regional government known as Metropolitan Toronto. The postwar boom had resulted in rapid suburban development. It was believed a coordinated land-use strategy and shared services would provide greater efficiency for the region. The metropolitan government began to manage services that crossed municipal boundaries, including highways, police services, water and public transit. In that year, a half-century after the Great Fire of 1904, disaster struck the city again when Hurricane Hazel brought intense winds and flash flooding. In the Toronto area, 81 people were killed, nearly 1,900 families were left homeless, and the hurricane caused more than CA$25 million in damage.\\n\\nIn 1967, the seven smallest municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto were merged with larger neighbours, resulting in a six-municipality configuration that included the former city of Toronto and the surrounding municipalities of East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough, and York.\\nIn the decades after World War II, refugees from war-torn Europe and Chinese job-seekers arrived, as well as construction labourers, particularly from Italy and Portugal. Toronto\\'s population grew to more than one million in 1951 when large-scale suburbanization began and doubled to two million by 1971. Following the elimination of racially based immigration policies by the late 1960s, Toronto became a destination for immigrants from all over the world. By the 1980s, Toronto had surpassed Montreal as Canada\\'s most populous city and chief economic hub. During this time, in part owing to the political uncertainty raised by the resurgence of the Quebec sovereignty movement, many national and multinational corporations moved their head offices from Montreal to Toronto and Western Canadian cities.\\n\\nOn January 1, 1998, Toronto was greatly enlarged, not through traditional annexations, but as an amalgamation of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and its six lower-tier constituent municipalities: East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough, York, and the original city itself. They were dissolved by an act of the Government of Ontario and formed into a single-tier City of Toronto (colloquially dubbed the \"megacity\"), replacing all six governments.\\nThe merger was proposed as a cost-saving measure by the Progressive Conservative provincial government under premier Mike Harris. The announcement touched off vociferous public objections. In March 1997, a referendum in all six municipalities produced a vote of more than 3:1 against amalgamation. However, municipal governments in Canada are creatures of the provincial governments, and referendums have little to no legal effect. The Harris government could thus legally ignore the referendum results and did so in April when it tabled the City of Toronto Act. Both opposition parties held a filibuster in the provincial legislature, proposing more than 12,000 amendments that allowed residents on streets of the proposed megacity to take part in public hearings on the merger and adding historical designations to the streets. This only delayed the bill\\'s inevitable passage, given the Progressive Conservatives\\' majority.\\nNorth York mayor Mel Lastman became the first \"megacity\" mayor, and the 62nd mayor of Toronto, with his electoral victory. Lastman gained national attention after multiple snowstorms, including the January Blizzard of 1999, dumped 118 centimetres (46 in) of snow and effectively immobilized the city. He called in the Canadian Army to aid snow removal by use of their equipment to augment police and emergency services. The move was ridiculed by some in other parts of the country, fuelled in part by what was perceived as a frivolous use of resources.\\n\\n\\n=== 21st century ===\\n\\nThe city attracted international attention in 2003 when it became the centre of a major SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak. Public health attempts to prevent the disease from spreading elsewhere temporarily dampened the local economy. From August 14 to 17, 2003, the city was hit by a massive blackout which affected millions of Torontonians (it also affected most of Southern Ontario and parts of the United States), stranding some hundreds of people in tall buildings, knocking out traffic lights and suspending subway and streetcar service across the city during those aforementioned days.\\nOn March 6, 2009, the city celebrated the 175th anniversary of its inception as the City of Toronto in 1834. Toronto hosted the 4th G20 summit during June 26–27, 2010. This included the largest security operation in Canadian history. Following large-scale protests and rioting, law enforcement arrested more than 1,000 people, the largest mass arrest in Canadian history.\\n\\nOn July 8, 2013, severe flash flooding hit Toronto after an afternoon of slow-moving, intense thunderstorms. Toronto Hydro estimated 450,000 people were without power after the storm and Toronto Pearson International Airport reported 126 mm (5 in) of rain had fallen over five hours, more than during Hurricane Hazel. Within six months, from December 20 to 22, 2013, Toronto was brought to a near halt by the worst ice storm in the city\\'s history, rivalling the severity of the 1998 Ice Storm (which mainly affected southeastern Ontario, and Quebec). At the height of the storm, over 300,000 Toronto Hydro customers had no electricity or heating. Toronto hosted WorldPride in June 2014, and the Pan and Parapan American Games in 2015.\\nThe city continues to grow and attract immigrants. A 2019 study by Toronto Metropolitan University (then known as Ryerson University) showed that Toronto was the fastest-growing city in North America. The city added 77,435 people between July 2017 and July 2018. The Toronto metropolitan area was the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in North America, adding 125,298 persons, compared with 131,767 in the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metroplex in Texas. The large growth in the Toronto metropolitan area is attributed to international migration to Toronto.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Canada first occurred in Toronto and was among the hotspots in the country.\\nToronto was named as one of 16 cities in North America (and one of two Canadian cities) to host matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\nToronto covers an area of 630 square kilometres (243 sq mi), with a maximum north–south distance of 21 kilometres (13 mi). It has a maximum east–west distance of 43 km (27 mi), and it has a 46-kilometre (29 mi) long waterfront shoreline, on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario. The Toronto Islands and Port Lands extend out into the lake, allowing for a somewhat sheltered Toronto Harbour south of the downtown core. An Outer Harbour was constructed southeast of downtown during the 1950s and 1960s, and it is now used for recreation. The city\\'s limits are formed by Lake Ontario to the south, the western boundary of Marie Curtis Park, Etobicoke Creek, Eglinton Avenue and Highway 427 to the west, Steeles Avenue to the north and the Rouge River and the Scarborough–Pickering Townline to the east.\\n\\n\\n=== Topography ===\\n\\nThe city is mostly flat or gentle hills, and the land gently slopes upward away from the lake. The flat land is interrupted by the Toronto ravine system, which is cut by numerous creeks and rivers of the Toronto waterway system, most notably the Humber River in the west end, the Don River east of downtown (these two rivers flanking and defining the Toronto Harbour), and the Rouge River at the city\\'s eastern limits. Most of the ravines and valley lands in Toronto today are parklands and recreational trails are laid out along the ravines and valleys. The original town was laid out in a grid plan on the flat plain north of the harbour, and this plan was extended outwards as the city grew. The width and depth of several of the ravines and valleys are such that several grid streets, such as Finch Avenue, Leslie Street, Lawrence Avenue, and St. Clair Avenue, terminate on one side of a ravine or valley and continue on the other side. Toronto has many bridges spanning the ravines. Large bridges such as the Prince Edward Viaduct were built to span broad river valleys.\\nDespite its deep ravines, Toronto is not remarkably hilly, but its elevation does increase steadily away from the lake. Elevation differences range from 76.5 metres (251 ft) above sea level at the Lake Ontario shore to 209 m (686 ft) above sea level near the York University grounds in the city\\'s north end at the intersection of Keele Street and Steeles Avenue. There are occasional hilly areas; in particular, midtown Toronto, as well as the Silverthorn and Fairbank neighbourhoods, have several sharply sloping hills. Lake Ontario remains occasionally visible from the peaks of these ridges as far north as Eglinton Avenue, 7 to 8 kilometres (4.3 to 5.0 mi) inland.\\n\\nThe other major geographical feature of Toronto is its escarpments. During the last ice age, the lower part of Toronto was beneath Glacial Lake Iroquois. Today, a series of escarpments mark the lake\\'s former boundary, known as the \"Iroquois Shoreline\". The escarpments are most prominent from Victoria Park Avenue to the mouth of Highland Creek, where they form the Scarborough Bluffs. Other observable sections include the area near St. Clair Avenue West between Bathurst Street and the Don River, and north of Davenport Road from Caledonia to Spadina Road; the Casa Loma grounds sit above this escarpment.\\nThe geography of the lakeshore has dramatically changed since the first settlement of Toronto. Much of the land on the harbour\\'s north shore is landfill, filled in during the late 19th century. Until then, the lakefront docks (then known as wharves) were set back farther inland than today. Much of the adjacent Port Lands on the harbour\\'s east side was a wetland filled in early in the 20th century. The shoreline from the harbour west to the Humber River has been extended into the lake. Further west, landfill has been used to create extensions of land such as Humber Bay Park.\\n\\nThe Toronto Islands were a natural peninsula until a storm in 1858 severed their connection to the mainland, creating a channel to the harbour. The peninsula was formed by longshore drift taking the sediments deposited along the Scarborough Bluffs shore and transporting them to the Islands area.\\nThe other source of sediment for the Port Lands wetland and the peninsula was the deposition of the Don River, which carved a wide valley through the sedimentary land of Toronto and deposited it in the shallow harbour. The harbour and the channel of the Don River have been dredged numerous times for shipping. The lower section of the Don River was straightened and channelled in the 19th century. The former mouth drained into a wetland; today, the Don River drains into the harbour through a concrete waterway, the Keating Channel. To mitigate flooding in the area, as well as to create parkland, a second more natural mouth was built to the south during the first half of the 2020s, thereby creating a new island, Ookwemin Minising.\\n\\n\\n=== Neighbourhoods and former municipalities ===\\n\\nToronto encompasses an area formerly administered by several separate municipalities that were amalgamated over the years. Each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdale, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city, there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.\\nThe many residential communities of Toronto express a character distinct from the skyscrapers in the commercial core. Victorian and Edwardian-era residential buildings can be found in enclaves such as Rosedale, Cabbagetown, The Annex, and Yorkville. The Wychwood Park neighbourhood, historically significant for the architecture of its homes, and for being one of Toronto\\'s earliest planned communities, was designated as an Ontario Heritage Conservation district in 1985. The Casa Loma neighbourhood is named after \"Casa Loma\", a castle built in 1911 by Sir Henry Pellat, complete with gardens, turrets, stables, an elevator, secret passages, and a bowling alley. Spadina House is a 19th-century manor that is now a museum.\\n\\n\\n==== Old Toronto ====\\n\\nThe pre-amalgamation City of Toronto covers the downtown core and older neighbourhoods to the east, west, and north. It is the most densely populated part of the city. The Financial District contains the First Canadian Place, Toronto-Dominion Centre, Scotia Plaza, Royal Bank Plaza, Commerce Court and Brookfield Place. This area includes, among others, the neighbourhoods of St. James Town, Garden District, St. Lawrence, Corktown, and Church and Wellesley. From that point, the Toronto skyline extends northward along Yonge Street.\\nOld Toronto is also home to many historically wealthy residential enclaves, such as Yorkville, Rosedale, The Annex, Forest Hill, Lawrence Park, Lytton Park, Deer Park, Moore Park, and Casa Loma, most stretching away from downtown to the north.\\nEast and west of downtown, neighbourhoods such as Kensington Market, Chinatown, Leslieville, Cabbagetown and Riverdale are home to bustling commercial and cultural areas as well as communities of artists with studio lofts, with many middle- and upper-class professionals.\\nOther neighbourhoods in the central city retain an ethnic identity, including two smaller Chinatowns, the Greektown area, Little Italy, Portugal Village, and Little India, among others.\\n\\n\\n==== Suburbs ====\\n\\nThe inner suburbs are contained within the former municipalities of York and East York. These are mature and traditionally working-class areas, consisting primarily of post–World War I small, single-family homes and small apartment blocks. Neighbourhoods such as Crescent Town, Thorncliffe Park, Flemingdon Park, Weston, and Oakwood Village consist mainly of high-rise apartments, which are home to many new immigrant families. During the 2000s, many neighbourhoods became ethnically diverse and underwent gentrification due to increasing population and a housing boom during the late 1990s and the early 21st century. The first neighbourhoods affected were Leaside and North Toronto, gradually progressing into the western neighbourhoods in York.\\n\\nThe outer suburbs comprising the former municipalities of Etobicoke (west), Scarborough (east) and North York (north) largely retain the grid plan laid before post-war development. Sections were long established and quickly growing towns before the suburban housing boom began and the emergence of metropolitan government, existing towns or villages such as Mimico, Islington and New Toronto in Etobicoke; Willowdale, Newtonbrook and Downsview in North York; Agincourt, Wexford and West Hill in Scarborough where suburban development boomed around or between these and other towns beginning in the late 1940s. Upscale neighbourhoods were built, such as the Bridle Path in North York, the area surrounding the Scarborough Bluffs in Guildwood, and most of central Etobicoke, such as Humber Valley Village, and The Kingsway. One of the largest and earliest \"planned communities\" was Don Mills, parts of which were first built in the 1950s. Phased development, mixing single-detached housing with higher-density apartment blocks, became more popular as a suburban model of development. During the late 20th century, North York City Centre and Scarborough City Centre developed separate downtown districts outside Downtown Toronto after the former boroughs were promoted to cities. High-rise development in these areas has given these former municipalities distinguishable skylines of their own, with high-density transit corridors serving them; some of these developments are also transit-oriented.\\n\\n\\n==== Industrial ====\\n\\nIn the 1800s, a thriving industrial area developed around Toronto Harbour and the lower Don River mouth, linked by rail and water to Canada and the United States. Examples included the Gooderham and Worts Distillery, Canadian Malting Company, the Toronto Rolling Mills, the Union Stockyards and the Davies pork processing facility (the inspiration for the \"Hogtown\" nickname). This industrial area expanded west along the harbour and rail lines and was supplemented by the infilling of the marshlands on the east side of the harbour to create the Port Lands. A garment industry developed along lower Spadina Avenue, the \"Fashion District\". Beginning in the late 19th century, industrial areas were set up on the outskirts, such as West Toronto / The Junction, where the Stockyards relocated in 1903. The Great Fire of 1904 destroyed a large amount of industry in the downtown. Some companies moved west along King Street, and some moved as far west as Dufferin Street, where the large Massey-Harris farm equipment manufacturing complex was located. Over time, pockets of industrial land mostly followed rail lines and later highway corridors as the city grew outwards. This trend continues to this day; the largest factories and distribution warehouses are in the suburban environs of Peel and York Regions, but also within the current city: Etobicoke (concentrated around Pearson Airport), North York, and Scarborough.\\n\\nMany of Toronto\\'s former industrial sites close to (or in) downtown have been redeveloped, including parts of the Toronto waterfront, the rail yards west of downtown, and Liberty Village, the Massey-Harris district and large-scale development is underway in the West Don Lands.\\nThe Gooderham & Worts Distillery produced spirits until 1990 and is preserved today as the \"Distillery District\", the largest and best-preserved collection of Victorian industrial architecture in North America. Some industry remains in the area, including the Redpath Sugar Refinery. Similar areas that retain their industrial character but are now largely residential are the Fashion District, Corktown, and parts of South Riverdale and Leslieville. Toronto still has some active older industrial areas, such as Brockton Village, Mimico and New Toronto. In the west end of Old Toronto and York, the Weston/Mount Dennis and The Junction areas still contain factories, meat-packing facilities and rail yards close to medium-density residential. However, the Junction\\'s Union Stockyards moved out of Toronto in 1994.\\nThe brownfield industrial area of the Port Lands, on the east side of the harbour, is one area planned for redevelopment. Formerly a marsh that was filled in to create industrial space, it was never intensely developed—its land unsuitable for large-scale development—because of flooding and unstable soil.\\nIt still contains numerous industrial uses, such as the Portlands Energy Centre power plant, port facilities, movie and television production studios, concrete processing facilities, and low-density industrial facilities. The Waterfront Toronto agency has developed plans for a naturalized mouth to the Don River and to create a flood barrier around the Don, making more of the land on the harbour suitable for higher-value residential and commercial development.\\nA former chemicals plant site along the Don River is slated to become a large commercial complex and transportation hub.\\n\\n\\n=== Architecture ===\\n\\nToronto\\'s buildings vary in design and age, with many structures dating back to the early 19th century, while other prominent buildings were just newly built in the first decade of the 21st century. Lawrence Richards, a member of the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Toronto, has said, \"Toronto is a new, brash, rag-tag place—a big mix of periods and styles.\" Bay-and-gable houses, mainly found in Old Toronto, are a distinct architectural feature of the city. Defining the Toronto skyline is the CN Tower, a telecommunications and tourism hub. Completed in 1976 at a height of 553.33 metres (1,815 ft 5 in), it was the world\\'s tallest freestanding structure until 2007 when it was surpassed by Burj Khalifa in Dubai.\\nToronto is a city of high-rises and had 1,875 buildings over 30 metres (98 ft) as of 2011.\\nThrough the 1960s and 1970s, significant pieces of Toronto\\'s architectural heritage were demolished to make way for redevelopment or parking. In contrast, since 2000, amid the Canadian property bubble, Toronto has experienced a condo construction boom and architectural revival, with several buildings opened by world-renowned architects. Daniel Libeskind\\'s Royal Ontario Museum addition, Frank Gehry\\'s remake of the Art Gallery of Ontario, and Will Alsop\\'s distinctive OCAD University expansion are among the city\\'s new showpieces. The mid-1800s Distillery District, on the eastern edge of downtown, has been redeveloped into a pedestrian-oriented arts, culture and entertainment neighbourhood. This construction boom has some observers call the phenomenon the Manhattanization of Toronto after the densely built island borough of New York City.\\n\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\n\\nThe city of Toronto has a hot summer humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfa), though was on the threshold of a warm summer humid continental climate (Dfb) until the 20th century due to the urban heat island but still found in the metropolitan region, with warm, humid summers and cold winters. According to the classification applied by Natural Resources Canada, the city of Toronto is in plant hardiness zone 7a. Some suburbs and nearby towns have lower zone ratings.\\nThe city experiences four distinct seasons, with considerable variance in length. As a result of the rapid passage of weather systems (such as high- and low-pressure systems), the weather is variable from day to day in all seasons. Owing to urbanization and its proximity to water, Toronto has a fairly low diurnal temperature range. The denser urbanscape makes for warmer nights year-round; the average nighttime temperature is about 3.0 °C (5.4 °F) warmer in the city than in rural areas in all months. However, it can be noticeably cooler on many spring and early summer afternoons under the influence of a lake breeze, since Lake Ontario is cool relative to the air during these seasons. These lake breezes mostly occur in summer, bringing relief on hot days. Other low-scale maritime effects on the climate include lake-effect snow, fog, and delaying of spring- and fall-like conditions, known as seasonal lag.\\nWinters are cold, with frequent snow. During the winter months, temperatures are usually below 0 °C (32 °F). Toronto winters sometimes feature cold snaps when maximum temperatures remain below −10 °C (14 °F), often made to feel colder by wind chill. Occasionally, they can drop below −25 °C (−13 °F). Snowstorms, sometimes mixed with ice and rain, can disrupt work and travel schedules while accumulating snow can fall anytime from November until mid-April. However, mild stretches also occur in most winters, melting accumulated snow. The summer months are characterized by very warm temperatures. Daytime temperatures are usually above 20 °C (68 °F), and often rise above 30 °C (86 °F). However, they can occasionally surpass 35 °C (95 °F) accompanied by high humidity. Spring and autumn are transitional seasons with generally mild or cool temperatures with alternating dry and wet periods. Daytime temperatures average around 10 to 12 °C (50 to 54 °F) during these seasons.\\n\\nPrecipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, but summer is usually the wettest season, the bulk falling during thunderstorms. The average yearly precipitation is 822.7 mm (32.4 in), with an average annual snowfall of 121.5 cm (48 in). Toronto experiences an average of 2,066 sunshine hours or 45 percent of daylight hours, varying between a low of 28 percent in December to 60 percent in July.\\nClimate change has affected Toronto, and as a consequence, the Toronto City Council declared a climate emergency, setting a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2040 through the TransformTO climate action plan. \\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Toronto was 40.6 °C (105 °F) on July 8, 9, and 10, 1936, during the 1936 North American heat wave. The coldest temperature ever recorded was −32.8 °C (−27 °F) on January 10, 1859.\\n\\n\\n=== Parks ===\\n\\nToronto has diverse public spaces, from city squares to public parks overlooking ravines. Nathan Phillips Square is the city\\'s main square in downtown, contains the Toronto Sign, and forms the entrance to City Hall. Yonge–Dundas Square, near City Hall, has also gained attention in recent years as one of the busiest gathering spots in the city. Other squares include Harbourfront Square, on the Toronto waterfront, and the civic squares at the former city halls of the defunct Metropolitan Toronto, most notably Mel Lastman Square in North York. The Toronto Public Space Committee is an advocacy group concerned with the city\\'s public spaces. In recent years, Nathan Phillips Square has been refurbished with new facilities, and the central waterfront along Queen\\'s Quay West has been updated recently with a new street architecture and a new square next to Harbourfront Centre.\\n\\nIn the winter, Nathan Phillips Square, Harbourfront Centre, and Mel Lastman Square feature popular rinks for public ice skating. Etobicoke\\'s Colonel Sam Smith Trail opened in 2011 and is Toronto\\'s first skating trail. Earl Bales Park offers outdoor skiing and snowboarding slopes with a chairlift, rental facilities, and lessons. Several parks have marked cross-country skiing trails.\\nThere are many large downtown parks, which include Allan Gardens, Christie Pits, Grange Park, Little Norway Park, Moss Park, Queen\\'s Park, Riverdale Park and Trinity Bellwoods Park. An almost-hidden park is the compact Cloud Gardens, which has both open areas and a glassed-in greenhouse, near Queen Street and Yonge Street. South of downtown are two large parks on the waterfront: Tommy Thompson Park on the Leslie Street Spit, which has a nature preserve and is open on weekends, and the Toronto Islands, accessible from downtown by ferry.\\n\\nLarge parks in the outer areas managed by the city include High Park, Humber Bay Park, Centennial Park, Downsview Park, Guild Park and Gardens, Sunnybrook Park and Morningside Park. Toronto also operates several public golf courses. Most ravine lands and river bank floodplains in Toronto are public parklands. After Hurricane Hazel in 1954, construction of buildings on floodplains was outlawed, and private lands were bought for conservation. In 1999, Downsview Park, a former military base in North York, initiated an international design competition to realize its vision of creating Canada\\'s first urban park. The winner, \"Tree City\", was announced in May 2000. Approximately 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres), or 12.5 percent of Toronto\\'s land base, is maintained parkland. Morningside Park is the largest park managed by the city, which is 241.46 hectares (596.7 acres) in size.\\nIn addition to public parks managed by the municipal government, parts of Rouge National Urban Park, the largest urban park in North America, is in the eastern portion of Toronto. Managed by Parks Canada, the national park is centred around the Rouge River and encompasses several municipalities in the Greater Toronto Area.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Toronto had a population of 2,794,356 living in 1,160,892 of its 1,253,238 total private dwellings, a change of 2.3 percent from its 2016 population of 2,731,571. With a land area of 631.1 km2 (243.7 sq mi), it had a population density of 4,427.8/km2 (11,467.8/sq mi) in 2021.\\nAt the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Toronto CMA had a population of 6,202,225 living in 2,262,473 of its 2,394,205 total private dwellings, a change of 4.6 percent from its 2016 population of 5,928,040. With a land area of 5,902.75 km2 (2,279.06 sq mi), it had a population density of 1,050.7/km2 (2,721.4/sq mi) in 2021.\\nIn 2016, persons aged 14 years and under made up 14.5 percent of the population, and those aged 65 and over made up 15.6 percent. The median age was 39.3 years. The city\\'s gender population is 48 percent male and 52 percent female. Women outnumber men in all age groups 15 and older.\\nThe 2021 census reported that immigrants (individuals born outside Canada) comprise 1,286,145 persons or 46.6 percent of the total population of Toronto. Of the total immigrant population, the top countries of origin were Philippines (132,980 persons or 10.3%), China (129,750 persons or 10.1%), India (102,155 persons or 7.9%), Sri Lanka (47,895 persons or 3.7%), Jamaica (42,655 persons or 3.3%), Italy (37,705 persons or 2.9%), Iran (37,185 persons or 2.9%), Hong Kong (36,855 persons or 2.9%), United Kingdom (35,585 persons or 2.8%), and Portugal (34,360 persons or 2.7%).\\nThe city\\'s foreign-born persons comprised 47 percent of the population, compared to 49.9 percent in 2006. According to the United Nations Development Programme, Toronto has the second-highest percentage of constant foreign-born population among world cities, after Miami, Florida. While Miami\\'s foreign-born population has traditionally consisted primarily of Cubans and other Latin Americans, no single nationality or culture dominates Toronto\\'s immigrant population, placing it among the most diverse cities in the world. In 2010, it was estimated over 100,000 immigrants arrived in the Greater Toronto Area each year.\\n\\n\\n=== Race and ethnicity ===\\nIn 2016, the three most commonly reported ethnic origins overall were Chinese (332,830 or 12.5 percent), English (331,890 or 12.3 percent) and Canadian (323,175 or 12.0 percent). Common regions of ethnic origin were European (47.9 per cent), Asian (including Middle-Eastern – 40.1 per cent), African (5.5 per cent), Latin/Central/South American (4.2 per cent), and North American aboriginal (1.2 per cent).\\n\\nIn 2016, 51.5 per cent of the residents of the city proper belonged to a visible minority group, compared to 49.1 per cent in 2011, and 13.6 per cent in 1981. The largest visible minority groups were South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan at 338,960 or 12.6 percent), East Asian (Chinese at 332,830 or 12.5 percent), and Black (239,850 or 8.9 percent). Visible minorities are projected to increase to 63 percent of the city\\'s population by 2031.\\nThis diversity is reflected in Toronto\\'s ethnic neighbourhoods, which include the Chinatowns, Corso Italia, Greektown, Kensington Market, Koreatown, Little India, Little Italy, Little Jamaica, Little Portugal and Roncesvalles (Polish community).\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\nAccording to the 2021 census, religious groups in Toronto included:\\n\\nChristianity (1,274,450 persons or 46.2%)\\nNo religion and secular perspectives (845,615 persons or 30.6%)\\nIslam (264,155 persons or 9.6%)\\nHinduism (171,980 persons or 6.2%)\\nJudaism (99,390 persons or 3.6%)\\nBuddhism (62,475 persons or 2.3%)\\nSikhism (21,545 persons or 0.8%)\\nIndigenous Spirituality (935 persons or <0.1%)\\nOther (20,730 persons or 0.8%)\\n\\n\\n=== Language ===\\n\\nEnglish is the predominant language spoken by Torontonians, with approximately 95 percent of residents having proficiency in it, although only 54.7 percent of Torontonians reported English as their mother tongue. Greater Toronto English, or simply Toronto slang, is a dialect found primarily in Toronto, primarily spoken by Millennials and members of Generation Z. English is one of two official languages of Canada, with the other being French. Approximately 1.6 percent of Torontonians reported French as their mother tongue, although 9.1 percent reported being bilingual in both official languages. In addition to services provided by the federal government, provincial services in Toronto are available in both official languages as a result of the French Language Services Act. Approximately 4.9 percent of Torontonians reported having no knowledge in either of the official languages of the country.\\nBecause the city is also home to many other languages, municipal services, most notably its 9-1-1 emergency telephone service, is equipped to respond in over 150 languages. In the 2001 Canadian census, the collective varieties of Chinese and Italian are the most widely spoken languages at work after English. Approximately 55 percent of respondents who reported proficiency in a Chinese language reported knowledge of Mandarin in the 2016 census.\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\n\\nToronto is an international centre for business and finance. Generally considered the financial and industrial capital of Canada, Toronto has a high concentration of banks and brokerage firms on Bay Street in the Financial District. The Toronto Stock Exchange is the world\\'s seventh-largest stock exchange by market capitalization. The five largest financial institutions of Canada, collectively known as the Big Five, all have their global corporate headquarters in Toronto, alongside Canada\\'s major insurance giants.\\n\\nThe city is an important centre for the media, publishing, telecommunication, information technology and film production industries; it is home to Bell Media, Rogers Communications, and Torstar. Other prominent Canadian corporations and Canadian subsidiaries of international corporations in the Greater Toronto Area include Magna International, Pizza Pizza, Mr. Sub, Celestica, Manulife, Sun Life Financial, Toyota Canada Inc. the Hudson\\'s Bay Company, and major hotel companies and operators, such as Four Seasons Hotels and Fairmont Hotels and Resorts.\\nAlthough much of the region\\'s manufacturing activities occur outside the city limits, Toronto continues to be a wholesale and distribution point for the industrial sector. The city\\'s strategic position along the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor within the Great Lakes megalopolis and its road and rail connections help support the nearby production of motor vehicles, iron, steel, food, machinery, chemicals and paper. The completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 gave ships access to the Great Lakes from the Atlantic Ocean.\\nToronto\\'s unemployment rate was 6.7 percent as of July 2016. According to the website Numbeo, Toronto\\'s cost of living plus rent index was second highest in Canada (of 31 cities). The local purchasing power was the sixth lowest in Canada, mid-2017. The average monthly social assistance caseload for January to October 2014 was 92,771. The number of impoverished seniors increased from 10.5 percent in 2011 to 12.1 percent in 2014. Toronto\\'s 2013 child poverty rate was 28.6 percent, the highest among large Canadian cities of 500,000 or more residents.\\n\\n\\n=== Bay Street ===\\n\\nThe Financial District in Toronto centres on Bay Street, the equivalent to Wall Street in New York. The city hosts the headquarters of all five of Canada\\'s largest banks, Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and was ranked as the safest banking system in the world between 2007 and 2014 according to the World Economic Forum. Toronto\\'s economy has seen a steady growth boom thanks to many corporations relocating their Canadian headquarters into the city and Canada\\'s growing cultural significance, resulting in several companies setting up shop in Toronto.\\n\\n\\n=== Media and entertainment ===\\n\\nToronto is Canada\\'s largest media market, and has four conventional dailies, two alt-weeklies, and three free commuter papers in a greater metropolitan area of about 6 million inhabitants. The Toronto Star and the Toronto Sun are the prominent daily city newspapers, while national dailies The Globe and Mail and the National Post are also headquartered in the city. The Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, and National Post are broadsheet newspapers. Several magazines and local newspapers cover Toronto, including Now and Toronto Life, while numerous magazines are produced in Toronto, such as Canadian Business, Chatelaine, Flare and Maclean\\'s. Daily Hive, Western Canada\\'s largest online-only publication, opened its Toronto office in 2016. Toronto contains the headquarters of the major English-language Canadian television networks CBC, CTV, Citytv, Global, The Sports Network (TSN) and Sportsnet. Much (formerly MuchMusic), M3 (formerly MuchMore) and MTV Canada are the main music television channels based in the city. However, they no longer primarily show music videos as a result of channel drift amid a shift in demographics.\\n\\n\\n==== Film production ====\\n\\nToronto is one of the centres of Canada\\'s film and television industry due in part to the lower cost of production in Canada. The city\\'s streets and landmarks are seen in a variety of films, mimicking the scenes of American cities such as Chicago and New York.

The structure of the municipal government is stipulated by the City of Toronto Act. The mayor of Toronto is elected by direct popular vote to serve as the chief executive of the city. The Toronto City Council is a unicameral legislative body, comprising 25 councillors, since the 2018 municipal election, representing geographical wards throughout the city. The mayor and members of the city council serve four-year terms without term limits. (Until the 2006 municipal election, the mayor and city councillors served three-year terms.)\\n\\nAs of 2016, the city council has twelve standing committees, each consisting of a chair (some have a vice-chair) and several councillors. The mayor names the committee chairs and the remaining members of the committees are appointed by city council. An executive committee is formed by the chairs of each standing committee, the mayor, the deputy mayor and four other councillors. Councillors are also appointed to oversee the Toronto Transit Commission and the Toronto Police Services Board.\\nThe city has four community councils that consider local matters. The City council has delegated final decision-making authority on local, routine matters, while others—like planning and zoning issues—are recommended to the city council. Each city councillor serves as a member of a community council.\\nThere are about 40 subcommittees and advisory committees appointed by the city council. These bodies are made up of city councillors and private citizen volunteers. Examples include the Pedestrian Committee, Waste Diversion Task Force 2010, and the Task Force to Bring Back the Don.\\nThe City of Toronto had an approved operating budget of CA$13.53 billion in 2020 and a ten-year capital budget and plan of CA$43.5 billion. The city\\'s revenues include subsidies from the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario (for programs mandated by those governments), 33 per cent from property tax, 6 per cent from the land transfer tax and the rest from other tax revenues and user fees. The city\\'s largest operating expenditures are the Toronto Transit Commission at CA$2.14 billion, and the Toronto Police Service, CA$1.22 billion.\\n\\n\\n=== Crime ===\\n\\nThe historically low crime rate in Toronto has resulted in the city having a reputation as one of the safest major cities in North America. For instance, in 2007, the homicide rate for Toronto was 3.43 per 100,000 people, compared with Atlanta (19.7), Boston (10.3), Los Angeles (10.0), New York City (6.3), Vancouver (3.1), and Montreal (2.6). Toronto\\'s robbery rate also ranks low, with 207.1 robberies per 100,000 people, compared with Los Angeles (348.5), Vancouver (266.2), New York City (265.9), and Montreal (235.3). Toronto has a comparable rate of car theft to various U.S. cities, although it is not among the highest in Canada.\\nIn 2005, Toronto media coined the term \"Year of the Gun\" because of a record number of gun-related homicides, 52 out of 80 homicides in total. The total number of homicides dropped to 70 in 2006; that year, nearly 2,000 people in Toronto were victims of a violent gun-related crime, about one-quarter of the national total. 86 homicides were committed in 2007, roughly half of which involved guns. Gang-related incidents have also been on the rise; between the years 1997 and 2005, over 300 gang-related homicides have occurred. As a result, the Ontario government developed an anti-gun strategy. In 2011, Toronto\\'s murder rate plummeted to 51 murders—nearly a 26% drop from the previous year. The 51 homicides were the lowest number the city has recorded since 1999 when there were 47. While subsequent years did see a return to higher rates, it remained nearly flat line of 57–59 homicides in from 2012 to 2015. 2016 went to 75 for the first time in over eight years. 2017 had a drop off of 10 murders to close the year at 65, with a homicide rate of 2.4 per 100,000 population.\\nThe total number of homicides in Toronto reached a record 98 in 2018; the number included fatalities from the Toronto van attack and the Danforth shooting, which gave the city a homicide rate of around 3.6 per 100,000 people. The record year for murders was previously 1991, with 89, at a rate of 3.9 murders per 100,000 people. The 2018 homicide rate was higher than in Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal, Hamilton, New York City, San Diego, and Austin. Homicides in 2019 dropped to 80 (a rate of 2.9 per 100,000 people) below the rate of most US cities, but still higher than the Canadian average of 1.8. Shooting incidents also increased to an all-time high of 492 in 2019, even outpacing gun incidents that occurred in 2018. 2020 saw another decrease in homicides with the city having a total of 71 murders for the year (a rate of around 2.6 per 100,000 people). However, in 2021, the city saw an increase in homicides, with the city murders increasing to 85, giving Toronto a homicide rate of 3.04 per 100,000 people. A decrease in murders happened the following year with 71 being reported in 2022 (a murder rate of 2.5 per 100,000), which was then followed by a slight increase in homicides with 73 being reported in 2023, giving the city a murder rate of 2.6 per 100,000 people, along with a record 12,143 reports of auto theft in the year. 2024 saw another increase in homicides with 85 being reported in the year, giving the city a homicide rate of around 3.04 per 100,000 people.\\n\\n\\n== Transportation ==\\n\\nToronto is a central transportation hub for road, rail, and air networks in Southern Ontario. The city has many forms of transport, including highways and public transit. Toronto also has an extensive network of bicycle lanes and multi-use trails and paths.\\n\\n\\n=== Public transportation ===\\n\\nToronto\\'s primary public transportation system is operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The backbone of its public transport network is the Toronto subway system, which includes three heavy-rail rapid transit lines spanning the city, including the U-shaped Line 1, east–west Line 2, and the short east–west Line 4 with Line 1 extending as far beyond city limits as Vaughan Metropolitan Centre.\\n\\nThe TTC also operates an extensive network of buses and streetcars, with the latter serving the downtown core and buses serving many parts of the city not served by the sparse subway network. TTC buses and streetcars use the same fare system as the subway, and many subway stations offer a fare-paid area for transfers between rail and surface vehicles.\\n\\nThere have been numerous plans to extend the subway and implement light-rail lines, but budgetary concerns have thwarted many efforts. By November 2011, construction on Line 5 Eglinton began. Line 5 is scheduled to finish construction by 2024. In 2015, the Ontario government promised to fund Line 6 Finch West, which is to be completed by 2024. In 2019, the Government of Ontario released a transit plan for the Greater Toronto Area which includes a new 16-kilometre (9.9 mi) Ontario Line, Line 1 extension to Richmond Hill Centre, a Line 2 extension to Sheppard Avenue / McCowan Road to replace Line 3, and an extension for Line 5 Eglinton to Toronto Pearson Airport.\\nToronto\\'s century-old Union Station is also getting a major renovation and upgrade which would be able to accommodate more rail traffic from GO Transit, Via Rail, UP Express and Amtrak. Construction on a new Union Station Bus Terminal is also in the works with an expected completion in 2020. Toronto\\'s public transit network also connects to other municipal networks such as York Region Transit, Viva, Durham Region Transit, Brampton Transit, and MiWay.\\nThe Government of Ontario operates a regional rail and bus transit system called GO Transit in the Greater Toronto Area. GO Transit carries over 250,000 passengers every weekday (2013) and 57 million annually, with a majority of them travelling to or from Union Station. Metrolinx is currently implementing Regional Express Rail into its GO Transit network and plans to electrify many of its rail lines by 2030.\\n\\n\\n=== Intercity transportation ===\\nToronto Union Station serves as a hub for VIA Rail\\'s intercity services in Central Canada and includes services to various parts of Ontario, Corridor services to Montreal and national capital Ottawa, and long-distance services to Vancouver and New York City.\\nGO Transit provides intercity bus services from the Union Station Bus Terminal and other bus terminals in the city to destinations within the Golden Horseshoe. Long-distance intercity coach services by multiple companies also operated from the Union Station Bus Terminal and provide a network of services to further cities in Ontario, neighbouring provinces, and the United States. The Toronto Coach Terminal formerly served as the city\\'s intercity coach hub from 1931 to 2021, when the terminal was decommissioned.\\n\\n\\n=== Airports ===\\n\\nCanada\\'s busiest airport, Toronto Pearson International Airport (IATA: YYZ), straddles the city\\'s western boundary with the suburban city of Mississauga. The Union Pearson Express (UP Express) train service provides a direct link between Pearson International and Union Station. It began carrying passengers in June 2015.\\nLimited commercial and passenger service to nearby destinations in Canada and the United States is offered from the Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (IATA: YTZ) on the Toronto Islands, southwest of downtown. Downsview Airport (IATA: YZD), near the city\\'s north end, is owned by de Havilland Canada and serves the Bombardier Aviation aircraft factory.\\nWithin a few hours\\' drive, Hamilton\\'s John C. Munro International Airport (IATA: YHM) and Buffalo\\'s Buffalo Niagara International Airport (IATA: BUF) serve as alternate airports for the Toronto area in addition to serving their respective cities. A secondary international airport, to be located northeast of Toronto in Pickering, has been planned by the Government of Canada.\\n\\n\\n=== Streets and highways ===\\n\\nThe grid of major city streets was laid out by a concession road system, in which major arterial roads are 6,600 ft (2.0 km) apart (with some exceptions, particularly in Scarborough and Etobicoke, as they used a different survey). Major east-west arterial roads are generally parallel with the Lake Ontario shoreline, and major north–south arterial roads are roughly perpendicular to the shoreline, though slightly angled north of Eglinton Avenue. This arrangement is sometimes broken by geographical accidents, most notably the Don River ravines. Toronto\\'s grid north is approximately 18.5° to the west of true north. Many arterials, particularly north–south ones, due to the city originally being within the former York County, continue beyond the city into the 905 suburbs and further into the rural countryside.\\nThere are several municipal expressways and provincial highways that serve Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area. In particular, Highway 401 bisects the city from west to east, bypassing the downtown core. It is the busiest road in North America,\\nand one of the busiest highways in the world. Other provincial highways include Highway 400, which connects the city with Northern Ontario and beyond and Highway 404, an extension of the Don Valley Parkway into the northern suburbs. The Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), North America\\'s first divided intercity highway, terminates at Toronto\\'s western boundary and connects Toronto to Niagara Falls and Buffalo. The main municipal expressways in Toronto include the Gardiner Expressway, the Don Valley Parkway, and, to some extent, Allen Road. Toronto\\'s traffic congestion is one of the highest in North America, and is the second highest in Canada after Vancouver.\\n\\n\\n== Sister cities ==\\n\\n\\n=== Partnership cities ===\\n\\n\\n=== Friendship cities ===\\n\\n\\n== Notable people ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nOutline of Toronto (extensive topic list)\\nGreat Lakes megalopolis\\nLargest cities in the Americas\\nList of metropolitan areas in the Americas\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Bibliography ===\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website \\n Geographic data related to Toronto at OpenStreetMap'"

For ease of reference, the methodology is referred to as the systemic textual analysis methodology (STAM). Following trends in hermeneutics and linguistics, STAM balances objective and subjective aspects of the process of textual analysis by using the notion of a ‘recoverable’ textual analysis.

Such analysis supports critical evaluation of texts in terms of characteristics such as content, descriptive quality, logical structure, overall coherence and completeness. The basic tenet of STAM is that textual data can be represented as a set of activities, and therefore conceptualized as an activity system. STAM operationalizes this approach in the form of a six-step process. The paper includes a simplistic exemplification of STAM where it is used to analyze a short piece of text.

Whilst STAM, therefore, has a wide range of potential application areas, to aid exposition of the methodology in this paper and to accurately document its initial period of development, STAM is presented here in a form suitable for the analysis of a particular type of text; namely, written texts which constitute formal descriptions of processes or methodologies. A short exemplification of the methodology is also provided; again, to aid exposition of the methodology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper is split into four main sections. The Section (The Research Programme of Stam) introduces the research programme of STAM. The Section (An Historical Review of Textual Analysis) begins with an historical overview of textual analysis within the traditions of hermeneutics and linguistics in order to support a conceptualization of the process of textual analysis involving objective, subjective and contextual elements (Conceptualizing the Process of Textual Analysis). The notion of a ‘recoverable’ textual analysis using HAS modelling is then presented in the Sub Section (Recoverability) as a solution to the problem of how to ‘balance’ the objective and subjective features of the process of textual analysis. The next Sub Section presents STAM itself; first, by outlining the use of HAS modelling for textual analysis (Textual Analysis Using HAS Modelling), second describing the steps of STAM in detail (A Systemic Methodology for Textual Analysis (STAM)) and finally giving a short illustrative application of the methodology (An Illustration of the Methodology). The final section (Concluding Remarks) gives concluding remarks and outlines of further research.\n",
      "\n",
      "# THE RESEARCH PROGRAMME OF STAM\n",
      "\n",
      "STAM was initially developed for the analysis of published academic texts within the discipline of Management Science. Specifically, the analysis of texts which constitute formal descriptions of processes, methods or methodologies. For example, Jenkins (1969), ‘The Systems Approach’, which describes a Systems Engineering methodology developed at Lancaster University in the UK, was considered a suitable text for analysis. The purpose of the textual analysis was to support (a) critical evaluation of the chosen texts, (b) analysis of the historical development of methodologies over time and (c) discussion on the formal presentation of methods and methodologies (Hindle, 2003).\n",
      "\n",
      "STAM was developed in such a way as to provide a rigorous analytical platform for critical evaluation in terms of textual characteristics (Nunan, 1993) such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Content—what activities does the text prescribe?\n",
      "- Descriptive quality—are the activities clearly described in the text?\n",
      "- Logical structure—are activities logically ordered in the text?\n",
      "- Overall identity and coherence—what identity do the activities presented in the text generate as a whole and is this coherent?\n",
      "- Completeness—given a particular interpretation of the identity of the methodology described in the text, do there appear to be any activities missing?\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial stages of the research programme of STAM were exploratory in nature. In order to develop a relatively stable first version of STAM, the research employed an ‘evolutionary’ research approach involving a combination of literature review—in the area of textual analysis, internal piloting—use of the methodology by the author on several texts and external testing—having several different users try the methodology in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The research programme involved the following four main steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Create an initial version of STAM using an adapted version of the HAS modelling language. This process was informed by a literature review of the discipline of textual analysis.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Pilot the initial version of STAM on a set of methodological texts. Each pilot application was slightly different due to differences in the target texts and each generated new learning regarding the development of STAM.\n",
      "2. Based on the piloting process, test a developed version of STAM with several users to see how the method would be used by analysts other than the author.\n",
      "3. Finally, examine extensions and applications of STAM in a preliminary way in order to identify further opportunities for research. The research design is represented diagrammatically in Figure 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the initial area of application of STAM being the critical evaluation and historical development of methods and methodologies, the research programme has examined three other areas of application. Firstly, STAM can be used to support the comparison of different texts; for example, the comparison of different methodologies. Secondly, STAM can be used in a more interpretative or creative mode in order to (a) redesign existing texts, (b) design new texts and (c) generate rigorous alternative interpretations of textual data based upon explicit theoretical positions or ‘worldviews’. Thirdly, the approach can make a useful contribution to the growing use of systems modelling and problem structuring methods (PSMs) within applied research.\n",

      "# AN HISTORICAL REVIEW OF TEXTUAL ANALYSIS\n",
      "\n",
      "This section gives a brief historical review of textual analysis based upon the disciplines of hermeneutics and linguistics. The purposes being (a) to give support to the conceptualization of the process of textual analysis developed in Sub Section Conceptualizing the Process of Textual Analysis and (b) to give support to the argument, based upon Lehtonen (2000) that it is feasible and desirable to develop a methodology for textual analysis which is able to ‘balance’ objective and subjective features of the process of textual analysis (Sub Section Recoverability).\n",
      "\n",
      "Appreciation of the process of textual analysis might start with Hermes, the mythological messenger God of the Greeks, who, when faced with the momentous task of delivering the Gods’ messages to mere mortals, needed to first interpret the Gods’ messages and then translate and explicate their meaning in a language normal people could understand. This was considered a ‘hermeneutic’ task requiring considerable expertise, (hermeneuein, Greek, ‘to interpret’). Aristotle also used the same term within the title for one of his works (Peri Hermeneias) where he examined the logic of statements, that is, the grammatical structures through which subject and predicate are connected in language. However, it was not until after the Renaissance and Reformation that ‘hermeneutics’ became a special discipline in the hands of the Protestant hermeneuticians, and formal methods for textual analysis were developed (Mueller-Vollmer, 1994).\n",
      "\n",
      "Faced with the Catholic Church’s insistence on their authority regarding the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures, 16th century Protestants, such as Matthias Flacius Illyricus, presented principles of perspicuity and argued for the self-sufficiency of the holy text. Illyricus argued the Scriptures contained internal coherence and continuity and therefore, if they had not been properly understood as yet, it was more a reflection on the knowledge and ability of the analysts than on the texts themselves.\n",

      "\n",
      "The emergence of further developments in hermeneutics may be traced back to developments in philosophy during the 18th century Enlightenment. In a similar manner to Aristotle and the Protestant hermeneuticians, Enlightenment philosophers, such as Wolff and Chladenius, viewed hermeneutic problems as belonging to the domain of logic and set about determining a set of generally applicable rules and principles that would be valid for all fields of knowledge which relied on the practice of textual analysis. The meaning of a text ought not to be problematic, they argued, as language, if used properly, would always faithfully communicate the intended meaning of the author. Ambiguity of text could only be due to an incorrect use of language, unclear definition of terms or poor construction of arguments by the author (Mueller-Vollmer, 1994).\n",

      "More recent approaches to textual analysis within hermeneutics have developed considerably from these early views of textual analysis as being concerned with the ‘correct’ (or objective) analysis of texts. Contributions from researchers such as Schleiermacher, Humboldt, Droysen, Boeckt, Dilthey, Ricoeur, Heidegger and Gadamer (Burrell and Morgan, 1979; Mueller-Vollmer, 1994) led to positions which increasingly adopted interpretive considerations. Such positions stemmed from a growing awareness of the subjective, linguistic and contextual influences on the symbiotic processes of textual production (by the author) and textual analysis (by the reader).\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar shift from objective analysis towards more interpretive considerations has been emerging within the discipline of linguistics (Brown and Yule, 1983). As with Anglo-American analytical philosophy (Martinich, 1996; Youle, 1996), linguistics has, traditionally, been primarily concerned with objective and grammatical features of the text—that is, the logic of words, sentences and paragraphs. More recently, however, linguistics has been exploring the relevance and applicability of its methods at deeper levels—for example, coherence, meaning, interpretation and so on. These tensions are illustrated in the quotes below.\n",

      "Sinclair (1994) states:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We should not impose our ideas on it (the text), except, perhaps, just to get started. We should only apply loose and flexible frameworks until we see what the preliminary results are in order to accommodate the new information that will come from the text’.\n",

      "In contrast, Enkvist (1989) states:\n",

      "These quotes are indicative of current debate within linguistics concerning the balance that should be struck between the more prevalent analytical/positivistic and the more recently adopted hermeneutic approaches; bottom-up ‘open-minded’ versus top-down interpretive approaches; concerns for verification versus concerns for social relevance and so on. Such differences of perspective are directly mirrored in the research described here and help to clarify and confirm the desirability of approaches that seek to ‘balance’ contrasting methodologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, many methods and approaches are evident in the literature from the fields of linguistics and hermeneutics, but there are a number of similar themes. Early approaches from both linguistics and hermeneutics tend to focus on the text itself, looking for objective features and examining the logic of language. There is an underlying assumption there ought to be a ‘correct’ (objective) meaning of a particular text so long as both author and analyst have fulfilled their roles competently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later approaches have given the process of textual interpretation much greater attention and have uncovered serious difficulties with the assumptions underlying an objective textual analysis. These difficulties include (i) separation between the context of the production of the text and the context of the analysis, (ii) subjective elements in the interpretation of the text by the analyst (iii) the constraining (and controlling) nature of the language system being used and (iv) the relationship between a particular sentence and the overall meaning of a piece of text.\n",

      "\n",
      "This section outlines a conceptualization of the process of textual analysis and identifies the key elements, as shown in Figure 2. A fundamental distinction is made between the context of production and the context of analysis (Gadamer, 1994; Lehtonen, 2000). Any text will be produced by an author(s) within a particular context. Elements of this context will include the author’s perspective (or Weltanschauung), the genre of production (purpose, style, format of the text), the physical production (the text itself as a physical entity), the historical context (the culture of work/society and the author’s working environment) and the language system used. The total effect of these elements (and others) will amount to a unique context for the production of each text. The context might be characterized by the analyst, but never defined absolutely (Gadamer, 1994). Even a second analysis by the same analyst would necessarily take place in a different context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text links these two contexts. The text might be considered to remain reasonably consistent, but even here changes are likely between production and analysis. At the very least, the physical production of the text (in terms of paper, printing, font, form of publication) is likely to be different, unless the analyst has access to the original script of the author. There may also be changes to the wording of the text due to copyediting, translation or different versions or editions of the text (Brown and Yule, 1983).\n",

      "This paper argues, following Lehtonen (2000), it is feasible and desirable to develop a methodology for textual analysis which is able to ‘balance’ objective and subjective aspects of the process of textual analysis. Such a methodology, whilst unable to produce an objective analysis of a piece of text, should nevertheless be applied in a traditional analytical mode. The analysis should link closely to the physical reality of the text—the letters, words and sentences—whilst synchronously being conscious of the interpretive and contextual elements within the steps of the analysis.\n",

Checkland and Holwell present an argument for a form of validation for Action Research which ‘can sustain action research (AR) as a legitimate form of enquiry which can be defended’. Their claim of validity for AR is based upon the notion of a recoverable research process involving the prior declaration of an epistemology in terms of which knowledge findings can be expressed.\n",

      "Checkland and Holwell describe a spectrum of knowledge acquisition processes from natural science at the one end to research story telling at the other. They argue there will be different criteria along the spectrum for judging the ‘truth value’ of the outputs of the processes from ‘public repeatability’ in natural science (considered to be the strongest truth claim) to ‘plausibility’ in research story telling (considered to be much weaker). The challenge for Action Researchers, they argue, is to do better than settling for ‘plausibility’, simply because ‘the strong criterion of ‘‘repeatability’’ (of natural science) is beyond their reach’ (Checkland and Holwell, 1998).\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Our argument here is that the aim in AR [Action Research] should be to enact a process based upon a declared-in-advance methodology (encompassing a particular framework of ideas) in such a way that the process is recoverable by anyone interested in subjecting the research to critical scrutiny’. (Checkland and Holwell, 1998 p. 18)\n",

      "Checkland and Holwell give an example of a piece of research conducted in the National Health Service of the United Kingdom by a multidisciplinary team of researchers from Lancaster University (Hindle et al., 1995; Checkland, 1997) to illustrate their notion of a recoverable research process.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The work used SSM in the sense-making ‘‘Mode 2’’ (Checkland and Scholes, 1990), with its particular framework of systemicity. The aim was to make clear to interested observers the thought processes and models which enabled the team to make their interpretations and draw their conclusions. Those observers might not accept the team’s interpretations; then a debate about the work could take place which was sufficiently well structured as to be coherent. The weaker ‘‘plausibility’’ criterion does not offer that prospect’. (Checkland and Holwell, 1998 p. 18)\n",
      "\n",
      "STAM uses the HAS modelling language in a similar sense-making mode (albeit modified) and claims to meet the same criterion of ‘recoverability’. The form of research, however, is clearly different. Rather than use the epistemology to document a ‘recoverable’ AR process, the epistemology is used to document a ‘recoverable’ textual analysis. The use of the epistemology is different, but the recoverability criterion remains unchanged. Hence, as with Checkland’s AR process, the textual analysis can be recovered by observers interested in subjecting the analysis to critical scrutiny. An interested observer may not agree with a particular textual analysis, but the analysis is produced in such a way as to enable a sufficiently well-structured debate.\n",

      "The texts analyzed within the piloting process of STAM were formal descriptions of Management Science methods or methodologies. Such texts take the general format of prescriptions for action—that is, they present a coherent set of actions placed (hopefully) in a logical order. The prescribed actions, taken as a whole, can then be assumed to achieve some kind of coherent overall purpose; for example, the design of an optimum system specification or improvement to a problematic situation. These texts represent specialized versions of the oldest body of literature in existence: ‘the advice manual or written regimen, whose origins can be traced back through medieval texts on regimen sanitatis to Pathagoras’s dire written warnings on the dangers of consuming beans’ (Brown, 1999).\n",

      "includes prescriptions for action; a set of actions, taken as a whole, constitutes a prescription for a process, which an observer may choose to conceptualize as a HAS. For example, a text prescribing a set of actions necessary to borrow a book from a library could be viewed as prescribing a process, which an observer could conceptualize as ‘A system to borrow a book from a library’.\n",
      "\n",
      "A text which gives a clear description of a set of activities which, taken as a whole, represent a clear transformation process (or purpose), will therefore be relatively straightforward to conceptualize as a HAS; that is, the process ‘underlying’ the author’s description of the method will map readily onto the HAS concept. And the reverse will be true. Difficulties will occur if the description of activities is unclear (to the observer) or the overall set of activities does not represent a clear or meaningful transformation process (to the observer).\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, the application of a method using HAS modelling can enable a textual analysis—that is, the application can surface characteristics (perhaps perceived as ‘strengths’ and ‘weaknesses’) of a text, from the point of view of an observer. In other words, perceived strengths and weaknesses will be surfaced through the text’s ability to ‘fit in’ with the conceptual schema of the method—that is, the text must have clearly described activities and the set of activities (as a whole) must represent a clear and meaningful transformation process.\n",

      "The text to be analyzed is referred to as the ‘target text’. A well-specified text is required in the sense the physical boundary of the text must be clear, that is, where it begins and where it ends. The text will be a complete description of a method or methodology (although other types of text may be possible). The text is assumed to be self-contained—contextual information relating to the production of the text or references to other texts cannot be included in the analysis. Each sentence in the target text is given a unique code for reference purposes.\n",

      "The text is studied and the activities identified in the text are listed. In principle, there are no restrictions on the number of activities within the list. The level of detail will depend on the text and a judgement made by the analyst. Only activities identified by the analyst in the text are to be included in the list. Each activity must be referenced back to a sentence(s) in the target text.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 3: Note Problems of Interpretation\n",
      "\n",
      "The process of identifying activities described in the text will generate problems of interpretation. For example, the analyst may be unfamiliar with the language used by the author or may feel a particular activity is under specified or poorly described. Such problems are systematically recorded.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 4: Construct Conceptual Model 1\n",
      "\n",
      "The activities identified in Step 2 are arranged into a conceptual model using the normal rules of HAS modelling—logical dependency. No activities are to be added to the model which are not in the activity list. Activities may be discarded only if duplicated in the model. It may not be possible to complete the logical dependencies between all activities in the model, as activities may be perceived to be missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 5: Infer Human Activity System\n",
      "\n",
      "The analyst studies the conceptual model and infers an underlying HAS. In other words, the analyst considers the activities in the model as a set and perceives an overall transformation process. The HAS is defined using a root definition of the format ‘a system to do P by Q in order to achieve R’ (Checkland and Scholes, 1999). A CATWOE analysis is also produced by the analyst in order to facilitate construction of the root definition. The intention is to represent the HAS perceived as underlying the conceptual model as accurately as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 6: Construct Conceptual Model 2\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 6 involves the construction of a second conceptual model according to the normal rules of HAS modelling—that is, an ideal type model based on the root definition in Step 5. It is worth noting that STAM runs the normal method of HAS modelling in reverse order (apart from Step 6). Normally, a user would start with an idea for an ideal-type HAS, articulate it with a root definition (and CATWOE) and then construct a conceptual model. Because the HAS would be ‘ideal’, both the root definition and the conceptual model would be ‘perfectly’ constructed from the point of view of the user—that is, the transformation process would be clear, the activities would be distinct and the structure of the model logically coherent. The six-step STAM process runs in the opposite direction. It starts (a) with the activities identified in the text, (b) places them in a conceptual model and then (c) infers a HAS. The analyst is likely to encounter ‘problems’ or perceive ‘weaknesses’ in the text at each stage of STAM. For example, the activities may be indistinct or difficult to interpret, the set of activities may form unclear, complex or multiple transformation processes, the conceptual model (Model 1) may include perceived ‘missing’ activities and the HAS may be difficult to define. Such ‘problems’, however, are vital to the success of the method, as they are regarded as being a product of the clash between text and systemic concept (although channelled by the interpretation of the text and application of STAM by the analyst). In other words, difficulties applying the method reflect characteristics of the text, from\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper presents a textual analysis methodology which utilizes the HAS concept from SSM (Checkland, 1981; Wilson, 1984) together with a modified version of the HAS modelling language. Textual analysis is a core activity for researchers in a number of academic disciplines within management, the arts and social sciences and therefore STAM has a wide range of potential application areas. Of particular relevance, however, are interpretive approaches to management research, applied discourse analysis and the softer end of Operational Research/Management Science practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the large number of potential application areas, STAM is presented in this paper in a form suitable for the analysis of a particular type of text; namely, texts which constitute formal descriptions of processes or methodologies. This is to enable detailed exposition of the methodology and to accurately document its initial period of development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper outlines the research programme of STAM, which involved a literature review of textual analysis, piloting of STAM by the author on several texts and testing of the method on other users. The paper then gives a brief historical overview of textual analysis within the traditions of hermeneutics and linguistics in order to support the argument that it is feasible and desirable to develop approaches to textual analysis which balance the objective and subjective elements of the process. The notion of a ‘recoverable’ textual analysis using HAS modelling is presented as a solution to the problem of how to achieve this balance in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper then presents a detailed description of STAM. Key features are its use of a systemic concept as a holistic interpretative device and a systems modelling language to provide analytical rigor. The systemic concept and modelling.\n",

      "language are modiﬁed versions of the HAS language taken from SSM. The underlying logic of the approach is that (a) textual data can be usefully conceptualized as a system and (b) the HAS modelling language represents a rigorous tool for constructing a recoverable analysis of the textual data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The research programme STAM is also examining three other potential areas of application.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, STAM can be used to support the comparison of different texts. Second, STAM can be used in a more interpretative or creative mode in order to (a) redesign existing texts, (b) design new texts and (c) generate rigorous alternative interpretations of textual data based upon explicit theoretical positions or ‘world-views’. Third, the approach can make a useful contribution to the growing use of systems modelling and PSMs within qualitative and applied research projects.\n",
